# WeatherX : my Weather app

## Status: Starting fresh

- I am making a clean break from my previous work on this project

- The original project, main and sub-branches of code and documentation, have been moved to a private repo.

### Project Summary

#### The App

  - A simple app that displays the current and forecasted weather conditions for a specific location.

#### Multiplatform and Universal

  - The entire app will be built with both front-end and server-side re-usable components.

  - The server-side components will be built to at least be easily adapted or ported for any production environment.

  - First, a web app version will be built.

  - Then an honest effort will be made to build the app for all major mobile device platforms.

#### Open Source

  - The code for the app will be maintained here on this public repo, to the extent possible.  Some key components and key data will have to be kept private, to ensure the security of the release versions of the app.

### Technologies to be used:

#### Server-side

- This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.Js](https://expressjs.com/) for https server and routing.

#### Database

- For database using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

#### User Interface

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for front-end UI

- May also use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts) for compiling React Components

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for porting to Android, Apple and Microsoft Windows platforms

#### Public API Sources

- [TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web)
  - for geocoding/geolocation services

- [Forcast.io](https://darksky.net/dev/docs)
  - public api has been closed since purchase by Apple

### Utility NPM packages to be used:

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
  - for making external api calls securely

- [Weather-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weather-icons)
  - for displaying icons to indicate forecasted weather conditions


- Lots and lots of other NPM packages...


- I wrote my own Date and Time conversion methods

### Standards:

- Trying to use all the latest web-standards!

#### Thanks to [Team TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)

- A great place for makers, breakers, engineers.

- Really a great place for anyone to brush-up on, gain new, or even get started in Software Development and information technology.
